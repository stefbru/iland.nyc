						<h2>Inspiration</h2>
						<p>
							"Donâ€™t leave your phone behind!" Sounds normal, right? 
							We are hooked! There is no turning back, this technology 
							is only ours to master. 
						<br>
						<br>
						</p>
						<p>
							The idea of spamming a specific-site comes from the urgency I see in our energy consumption. I asked myself: "How can I send a message and be certain people are going to read it...?" 
							<br>
							<br> 
							Captive portals are websites that pop-up when you are looking for phone reception. I decided to make a booklet to explain how to create a hotspot, a captive portal and a jamming system.

						<h2>An Egg</h2>
						<p>
							iLand is an exploratory campaign that provides tools such as portable 
							jamming devices, enabling the user to introduce another signal for 
							broadcasting of messages. I hope that it will be a message filled with 
							ideas of how we can battle excessive behavior, like smart-phone usage 
							and energy consumption. My devices will be able to block 3G and 4G 
							cellphone services and are meant to be used in spaces like parties 
							and other social gatherings.
 						<br>
 						<br>
						</p>
						<p>
							This thesis directly engages with the smartphone contradiction 
							(the toolkit is meant mostly for smartphones): technology that is 
							powerful enough to make anyone a world-wide broadcaster, has made us 
							all a private island when it comes to real time interaction.
