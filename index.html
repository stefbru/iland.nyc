One of them creates, perhaps, the primary product -- the thing we think we're paying for -- the other one creates a context within which we can enjoy and appreciate that product. And the idea that one of them should actually have priority over the other is fundamentally wrong.</a>

							This project demonstrates a set of physical 
							and digital components that interfere with network service. The toolkit not only blocks 
							cellular signal at sites of social gathering, 
							but also enables the broadcasting of multimedia
							messages through a wi-fi hotspot and captive portal.
							<br>
							<br>
							Mobile phone's isolation method (signal blockage) is made through an emission of elctromagnetism. The electromagnetic signal emitted by the isolator is completely in the range of the mobile phone frequency set by the state. It can only block off the communication of mobile phones. Its effective isolation diameter is of 40 meters. 
							<br>
							<br>
							Wi-fi hotspot operates in a local<a src="https://nycmesh.net/"> mesh-network</a>. People joining in will participate on a on-going internvention.
							<br>
							<br>
							NOTE: civilian use of mobile jamming is illegal in most countries. Audience most be aware of mobile phone's isolation proximity.

							<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">site specific spamming</span> feels similar as when you are at the airport. Airports block cellphone carriers and dynamize users to their network. iLand's open Wi-fi hotspot difference, is, that instead of submiting a name and an email, people are actually accesing a space. Space, is a local network, which broadcasts games, or videos, articles, etc.
							<br><br>
							The toolkit is design to be used in gathering spaces such as lounges, galleries, parties, restaurants, etc, allowing people to explore a new way of communication; a mobile local mesh-network. With the objective of  generating a temporary environment with an ambiance that moves away from the reliance of ‘rights’ and ‘laws’,  
							made by the state and recognize the potential emergence for conventions and protocols. Such conventions and 
							protocols evolve rapidly and are effective if the state does not intervene through regulation.</p>
