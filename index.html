Generalizations, and people not making connections (or pretending not to make connections). Connections in the sense of relating, associating. Because now a days you can not escape completely to another geographical location does not mean that you don't escape everyday from reality, especially through the use of our phones.

							This project demonstrates a set of physical 
							and digital components that interfere with network service. The toolkit not only blocks 
							cellular signal at sites of social gathering, 
							but also enables the broadcasting of multimedia
							messages through a wi-fi hot-spot and captive portal.

							<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">site specific spamming</span> feels similar as when you are at the airport. Airports block cellphone carriers and dynamize users to their network. iLand free wifi zone difference is that instead of submiting a name and an email, people are actually accesing a space. The space, is a local network, which broadcasts games, or videos, maybe articles, etc.
							<br><br>
							The toolkit is design to be used in gathering spaces such as lounges, galleries, parties, restaurants, etc, allowing people to explore a new way of communication; a mobile local mesh network.</p>
