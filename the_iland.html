			<p>This project aims to speak about media consumption by targeting Smartphone usage. Although, Smartphones (or lets called them by what they are, portable touch screen computers, not mobile phones) convenience and infinite capabilities are undeniable, many people have become dependent of them by spend too much time using / getting distracted with them. Excessive negligence of "real-time" presence or deeper interpersonal contact puts us in a private "iland" state of mind and I want to motivate people to think about their dependency as a manipulation that others has imposed on us.</p>
			<p>Portable technology, like every new introduction of an incredible technology, usage in public places has develop new social norms. It seems we are psychological absent when we are in public and paying to much of our attention to our Smartphones. Little touch screen computers has allowed the media, feeling-driven-disciplines that for decades -through the newspaper, television, radio, billboards- has competed for eyeballs attention, to expand across a territory that seems infinite. Over the past decade, billions of dollars have been invested in technologies that customize ads based precisely on individuals preferences, thanks to all the data we are putting out there.</p>
			<p>I refuse to conform with the compulsive addiction of swiping, clicking and posting, which we are not getting addicted by accident. Advertisers, like Kevin Roberts, CEO of Saatchi and Saatchi, claim that the buying decision is 80% emotional and 20% rational. He is repeating the words of Steven Overman, author of The Conscience Economy. A big time marketer that has been working for decades. This is exactly why the booming fields of behavioral economics and neuro-economics are telling us. Another "desire guru" Nir Eyal, has been quite a behavioral influencer. He has worked with some of the biggest Silicon Valley tech firms teaching them how to apply a system he developed for engineering habit-forming apps, services and games. At the center of Eyal's system is a four-step cycle he calls the Hook, which are Trigger, Action, Reward, Investment. These steps derived from his observation of online products and services as a wide range of physiological and neurological research. The Hook , Eyal says, is the "drug" behind just every icon of the consumer internet.

			<p>The media we consume educates us, influencing our attitudes, values, and tastes, putting us in a sort of permissive state that is perpetuating incorrect mass communication exercises. One's perception of reality is shaped by the information we are bombarded with. 
			</p>
			<p>Thus, I ask how can 'we' address how inaccurately the media is reflecting the world in which we live?
